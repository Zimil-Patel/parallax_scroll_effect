# Parallax Scroll Effect

The parallax scroll effect is a popular design technique where background elements move at a different speed than foreground elements while scrolling. This creates a sense of depth and immersion, making the user experience more engaging and visually appealing. In the context of a horizontal parallax scroll effect, elements move horizontally at different speeds, adding a dynamic and interactive layer to the user interface.
